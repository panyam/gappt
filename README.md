## Go App Template

A minimal template app for go backends that require:

1. Protos/GRPC services
2. Fronted by a gateway service
3. And powered by oauth

Other backend choices (like datastores) are upto the app/service dev, eg:

1. Which services are to be added.
2. Which backends are to be used (for storage, etc)
3. How to deploy them to specific hosting providers (eg appengine, heroku etc)
